# A Configuration-based Dependency Injection Framework for Building Deep Learning Model on TFLearn

This is a sample project of "Smart Customer Retention" building deep learning models using a configuration-based dependency injection framework on TFLearn.

---

## Overview
This sample consists of the following parts:
* __fraework__

	A dependency injection frameowrk with pre-built python modules to build deep learning models on TFLearn and TensorFlow.
	
* __app__

    A sample application of "Smart Customer Retntion" having two classifiers of predicting customer churn and providing customer retention recommendations.
